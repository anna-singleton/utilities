# bash env

this is a script which will allow me a virtual environment of sorts in bash,
when sshing into another server frequently i can scp this dir to the machine,
and use ./go and have a good config, without affecting others who may use the
machine.

this is WIP, may break, not work or never be finished, use at own risk.
